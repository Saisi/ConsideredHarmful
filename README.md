###INTRODUCTION

This paper investigates The Ropes - a popular Dining Application for Dartmouth students made by Dartmouth students. The latter group considered harmful. Using Ropes, we will examine how to not write iOS applications by demonstrating how to pilfer and extract instances of sensitive information from the app. After which, I give suggestions on how to secure apps and include working code of a sane and tamed application-server interaction model. This investigation is important because the App Store has lowered barriers of entry and distribution leading to a proliferation of equally wanting and insecure applications. As a consequence, many new and potential developers need to be aware of the additional effort they should incur in creating secure consumer facing applications
